          Protocol (IP) address, and domain name are all collected. This

          information to you and administer and improve the Site.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Log Files:</strong> As is true of most websites, we gather

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Analytics:</strong> We use analytics services (including, but
          not limited to, Google Analytics) to help analyze how users use the
          Site. Analytics services use Cookies to collect information such as
          how often users visit the Site and we use the information to improve
          our Site and Services. The analytics services' ability to use and
          share information collected by them is restricted by their terms of
          use and privacy policy, which you should refer to for more information
          about how these entities use this information.

          services on your mobile device, we may collect your location
          information to improve the Services we offer. If you do not want this
          information collected, you can disable location services on your
          device.

          <strong>Cookies:</strong> “Cookies” are small pieces of information
          (text files) that a website sends to your computers hard drive while
          you are viewing the website. These text files can be used by websites
          to make the users experience more efficient. The law states that we
          can store these cookies on your device if they are strictly necessary
          for the operation of this site. For all other types of cookies we need
          your permission. To that end, this site uses different types of
          cookies. Some cookies are placed by third party services that appear
          on our pages. We and some third parties may use both session Cookies
          (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies
          (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you
          with a more personal and interactive experience on our Services and to
          market the Services or other products. Marketing cookies are used to
          track visitors across websites. The intention is to display ads that
          are relevant and engaging for the individual user and thereby more
          valuable for publishers and third party advertisers. This tracking is
          done on an anonymous basis and, while not an exhaustive list, some of
          the companies we work with are Google, AppNexus, Criteo, Rubicon,
          Pubmatic and DistrictM. To learn more about this practice, including
